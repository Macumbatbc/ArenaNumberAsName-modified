A modified version of ArenaNumberAsName. This addon changes enemy players name to arena number instead.

This version just replace arena: 1(2-3-4-5) to class player (e.g. Mage) on target frame and on Nameplates.

If you want the Class player only on target frame take this version : https://github.com/Macumbatbc/ArenaNumberAsName-modified
